Number Guess

This project was provided by Roadmap.sh, at this link: https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game

This project is a simple number guessing game coded entirely in Python, using the random module.

To run this code without any issues, run this code in Python 3.9.0 or higher.

Clone the Python file into your IDE, and run the code to play the game.

Upon opening the game you will be prompted to select a difficulty level.

Easy: 10 tries
Medium: 5 tries
Hard: 3 tries

Once you select a difficulty, you will be entered into the game state,
where you will try guessing numbers until you have either found the
right answer, or have run out of chances. This part runs in a while
loop that ends either when the answer is correct, or when the number
of iterations equals the amount of guesses the player has.
